## Hi! üëã

Welcome to my personal website! Currently [I'm pursuing a PhD](https://www.uu.nl/medewerkers/AJHzuijderwijk) at the Department of Information and Computing Sciences of Utrecht University. My research is centered around the use of process science to further an [open government](https://www.open-overheid.nl/) and is funded by the Dutch [Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management](https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/ministeries/ministerie-van-infrastructuur-en-waterstaat).

There are many things that have my interest! I particularly like #electronics, building software, playing music (mainly the piano), graphic design, self-hosting stuff and watching bad movies. Primarily, this site was made to store (and share) my thoughts on topics that are interesting to me.

You might have noticed that site is not setup like a traditional blog (except for the writings under [[Blog]]). It is meant to be my *digital garden*, which is essentially a collection of notes that refer to each other. 

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note that this site is still a work in progress! I'm still transfering posts and features from my [Wordpress blog](https://joszuijderwijk.nl) to this site.
